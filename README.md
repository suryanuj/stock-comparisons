# Stock Comparisons
This program takes in user input, allowing them to enter how many stocks they want to analyze, 
and then takes each stock's last 5 closing prices and compares it with the other stocks you 
have listed. It also gives the percent change for the different stocks on a graph.

**Instructions**:
>To use the program, first enter the number of stocks you want to analyze. 
>Then enter the company name for each stock.
>Once you have entered all of the company names, the program will find the last closing price for each stock
>and report the data in the table and graph. You can use this program to compare different stocks
>side-by-side, which can help you make better decisions on different markets and stocks.
